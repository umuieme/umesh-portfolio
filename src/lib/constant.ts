        `I'm a mobile-first developer with a strong foundation in Flutter and native Android development. I also have hands-on experience with iOS development using SwiftUI and some exposure to React Native.`,
        `While my primary focus is mobile app development, I’m equally comfortable working on the backend — especially with Node.js and NestJS. I've built and deployed apps using cloud platforms like Appwrite and Firebase, enabling full-stack capabilities.`,
        `Outside of production work, I love exploring new technologies. Recently, I've been diving into frontend development with Next.js, experimenting with Figma for design, and learning more about the growing world of AI/ML.`,
        `I'm always excited to learn, build, and iterate on meaningful tech.`,
