        `I'm a problem-solver first, and a software developer second. My passion lies in building complete, end-to-end solutions that live on screens and servers alike..`,
        `My expertise covers the full application lifecycleâ€”from crafting intuitive mobile experiences using Flutter, native Android (Kotlin/Java), and SwiftUI, to engineering robust backend systems with Node.js and NestJS. I've had the privilege of not only building apps from scratch with services like Firebase and Appwrite, but also leading and mentoring development teams to deliver high-quality products.`,
        `I believe technology is a craft. This belief pushes me to constantly explore new domains to broaden my perspective, whether that means prototyping in Figma, diving into frontend with Next.js, or exploring the fascinating world of AI/ML.`,
        `Ultimately, I am driven by the process of learning, building, and iterating to create technology that makes a meaningful impact.`
